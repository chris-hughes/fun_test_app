This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Things to do

### `small things`

- mouseover nav buttons

### `functionality`

- nav buttons actually route places

###

- model of person?

`{
    "firstName": "Chris",
    "lastName": "Hughes",
    "teaching": [
      "Maths",
      "Guitar",
    ],
    "learning": [
      "React",
      "Trumpet",
    ]
  }`

### `questions`

- what should I be using as keys when iterating?
- why does css suck so so much?
- i still don't know how to test

## `Notes`

withStyles injects a `classes` prop. So you define a `style` object and then
apply the keys to as classes to the elements you want to style
